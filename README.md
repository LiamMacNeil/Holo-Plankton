# Holo-Plankton
Micro-mesoplankton groups imaged on the Newfoundland Shelf (Nov-Dec, 2019) aboard the *RRS James Cook*. Plankton are segmented from holograms collected using the HoloSeaS5 ([4Deep](http://4-deep.com/)). Raw holograms were reconstructed with 4Deep ([Octopus](http://4-deep.com/products/octopus-software/) software, and in-focus plankton were detected with the companion ([Stingray](http://4-deep.com/products/stingray-software/) software. Detecting in-focus plankton images or regions-of-interest (ROIs), depended on a pipeline for depthwise thresholding, clustering and pixel autocorrelation. All plankton were manually identified using various sources from the primary literature including several major guides <sup>(1-3) 
  

Beginning alphabetically, this will show the large-scale taxonomic (Phylum) resolution for major groups including lower level identification where possible.

## Final thoughts

Quantitative plankton imagery can seriously improve our *in-situ* sampling efforts: the high-throughput capacity of many instruments and the data-rich nature of digital images can expand our knowlegde of fine-scale biological properties, absolute community compositions, and render automation increasingly possible for major plankton groups and imaging types. Holography has some important advantages in rapidly sampling larger volumes at micron-level resolution, and for the case of digital **in-line** holographic microscopy, it is durable in hostile environments. Underpinning all this is the lensless design, which Dennis Gabor (1947) realized was the solution to abberation problems of early electron microscopes developed by Ernst Ruska: the only perfect lens is the point source laser sized less than or equal to a wavelength. This is idea has born many fruits 75 years later. Although the technical difficulty, and physics-driven approaches for numerical hologram reconstruction and segmenting an in-focus plankter from a messy volume of water is currently a barrier, the propespects of unifying colllection through to classification with deep learning (or similarly generalizable approaches) are improving. Overall, there are good reasons for their ascendency.
